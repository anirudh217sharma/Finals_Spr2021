Name : Unequal (Puzzle)

Fill in the grid with numbers from 1 to the grid size, so that every number appears exactly once in each row and column, and so that all the < signs represent true inequalities (i.e. the number at the pointed end is smaller than the number at the open end).

A valid puzzle must have at least a single row or column or a diagonal in numerical order. There is no constraints on the corners.

As a result now there is not restriction to work on a 4 * 4 grid so the implementation would be for a general n * n grid.
